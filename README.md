# Taskwarrior Utils

Taskwarrior is awesome.

The best thing about it is that you can build on top of it, to add all the functionality you want.

Here you'll find all the tools I've added to make it work the way I'd like.

### Open Notes
A simple tool to give you notes per task in one command. e.g.
```
task notes 12
```
[Find out more](./open_notes/)

### Add to
Adding a task to an existing project can be a pain. Sometimes it's nice to have longer, explanatory project names.
Especially when working with sub-projects.

Instead of having to copy and paste the project name this tool gives you a select capability, to search for a project
and then add multiple tasks once selected.

# More to come
I'll slowly be pushing my utils here as I tidy them up.
