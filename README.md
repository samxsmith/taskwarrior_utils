# Taskwarrior Utils

Taskwarrior is awesome.

The best thing about it is that you can build on top of it, to add all the functionality you want.

Here you'll find all the tools I've added to make it work the way I'd like.

### Open Notes
A simple tool to give you notes per task in one command. e.g.
```
task notes 12
```

# More to come
I'll slowly be pushing my utils here as I tidy them up.
